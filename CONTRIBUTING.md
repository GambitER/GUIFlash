# Some notes for contribution to this project:

If you want to contribute to the project you should discuss things with the project maintainer before you request a pull request.

Feel free to create a new topic here on the forum and let's discuss things and what do you want to change/enhance and why it's needed.

## Version numbering
The version numbering of the project follows the following format:

xx.yy.zz

xx - major version<br>
yy - minor version<br>
zz - build<br>

Version numbering is done by the project maintainer and should never be done by the project contributor itself. Please keep this in mind if you want to create a pull request.


## wotmod-file
Never try to merge the .wotmod-file into the repo. This will also be created by the project maintainer after your pull request was accepted or a new update was released. You can find the current release version here: [**Releases**](https://github.com/CH4MPi/GUIFlash/releases)

## a personal note
Help is always welcome. If you sent in a pull request, please wait if it will be accepted. You shouldn't release your changes to the community before the pull-request was accepted to avoid that there is more than one GUIFlash version outside.
